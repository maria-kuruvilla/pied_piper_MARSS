	title = {A review of the adaptive signiﬁcance and ecosystem consequences of zooplankton diel vertical migrations},
	abstract = {Diel vertical migration (DVM) by zooplankton is a universal feature in all the World’s oceans, as well as being common in freshwater environments. The normal pattern involves movement from shallow depths at night to greater depths during the day. For many herbivorous and omnivorous mesozooplankton that feed predominantly near the surface on phytoplankton and microzooplankton, minimising the risk of predation from ﬁsh seems to be the ultimate factor behind DVM. These migrants appear to use deep water as a dark daytime refuge where their probability of being detected and eaten is lower than if they remained near the surface. Associated with these vertical movements of mesozooplankton, predators at higher trophic levels, including invertebrates, ﬁsh, marine mammals, birds and reptiles, may modify their behaviour to optimise the exploitation of their vertically migrating prey. Recent advances in biotelemetry promise to allow the interaction between migrating zooplankton and diving air-breathing vertebrates to be explored in far more detail than hitherto.},

	abstract = {Diel vertically migrating zooplankton can contribute significantly to dissolved carbon and nutrient export by respiring and excreting surface-ingested particulate organic matter below the mixed layer. Active export of particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) due to defecation at depth has rarely been considered in export budgets. We measured the gut passage time (GPT) of common migrant species at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site, using the gut fluorescence method, to determine whether GPT is slow enough to allow active export of POC and PON to depth. Mean GPT for the copepods Pleuromamma xiphias and Euchirella messinensis was 191 and 114 min, respectively, and for the euphausiids Thysanopoda aequalis and Euphausia brevis (analyzed together) was 41 min, exceeding previously reported GPT for nonmigrating zooplankton by a factor of 6. Between 18 and 81\% of the initial gut pigment was retained in zooplankton guts upon descent below a mixed layer of 150 m. By comparing pigment ingestion rates (gut fluorescence technique) with total ingestion rates (CHN analysis of fecal material), we estimated that 71 to 85\% of the migrant diet originated from non-plant material, which we included in our estimates of active POC/PON export. We applied the mean weight-specific active POC/PON export rate for the species examined to the total migratory zooplankton biomass using data from the BATS zooplankton time-series. Mean active POC (PON) flux at BATS was 0.94 mg C m–2 d–1 (0.18 mg N m–2 d–1) and the maximum was 5.27 mg C m–2 d–1 (1.02 mg N m–2 d–1), corresponding to a mean of 3\% (4\%) and a maximum of 18\% (20\%) of the mean gravitational POC (PON) flux measured by sediment traps at 150 m. Migrants also contributed significantly to passive flux via production of sinking fecal pellets during the night in surface waters. This passive flux exceeded active POC flux by {\textasciitilde}10-fold. Freshly released feces by migrators at depth could be a valuable food source for mesopelagic organisms, in contrast to feces produced in surface waters which decompose while settling through the water column.},

	abstract = {Spatial patchiness of plankton enhances fishery production and carbon export in the ocean. While diel vertical migration (DVM) has been identified as an important factor contributing to vertical patchiness, its effect on horizontal patchiness has never been investigated. We use a simple individual-based zooplankton model to examine the effect of DVM on the horizontal patchiness of four zooplankton groups with differing DVM patterns in a two-dimensional ocean circulation model. We find that zooplankton horizontal patchiness can be induced by two mechanisms: (1) in stratified waters, DVM can synchronize zooplankton vertical positions with the horizontal current velocities that drive them, resulting in horizontal patchiness; and (2) migrating zooplankton tend to aggregate in deep waters when they encounter sea bottom. Due to these mechanisms, zooplankton horizontal patchiness may be ubiquitous in the ocean, enhancing secondary production and fisheries.},

This paper (Chen et al.) hypothesizes that DVM alone is required for horizontal patchiness.
They argue that because of gradients in horizontal current velocity, synchronized vertical positions (?) would lead to aggregations 
“We find that both DVM and the seamount can induce horizontal patchiness, via distinct mechanisms.” (Chen et al., 2021, p. 124)

“The third limitation is the difficulty of completely separating the effects on patchiness of bathymetry and DVM, respectively. One possibility would be to modify the bathymetry to examine the effect of bathymetry on zooplankton patchiness. However, the problem is that the patterns of ocean currents depend on bathymetry. We also tried to compare the patterns of zooplankton patchiness in the three different segments with different bathymetry. However, a similar problem remains: the ocean currents differ among the segments. However, while it is nearly impossible to completely separate these two effects, we can infer from our results that bathymetry and DVM each independently affect zooplankton horizontal patchiness, as discussed below.” (Chen et al., 2021, p. 131)

“Spatial patchiness is an important factor contributing to productivity (Woodson and Litvin 2015). Since water column stratification and seamounts can promote zooplankton patchiness, these two factors should also enhance secondary production and fisheries. It has been observed that aggregations of migrating zooplankton trapped within the trough of seamounts may attract predatory fish and become feeding hotspots for marine fish near seamounts (Genin et al.1988, 1994). Seamounts have been already reported as important sites for enhanced productivity and fisheries because of enhanced nutrient supply via N2 fixation or upwelling (Hasegawa et al. 2008, 2009; Shiozaki et al. 2014). This study provides evidence that seamounts can also enhance secondary production by promoting zooplankton patchiness.” (Chen et al., 2021, p. 133)

These declines combined with current overfishing, habitat degradation, and pollution paint a grim picture for the future of marine fisheries and ecosystems. However, current models forecasting such declines do not account for the effects of ocean fronts as biogeochemical hotspots. Here we apply a fundamental technique from fluid dynamics to an ecosystem model to show how fronts increase total ecosystem biomass, explain fishery production, cause regime shifts, and contribute significantly to global biogeochemical budgets by channeling nutrients through alternate trophic pathways. We then illustrate how ocean fronts affect fishery abundance and yield, using long-term records of anchovy–sardine regimes and salmon abundances in the California Current. These results elucidate the fundamental importance of biophysical coupling as a driver of bottom–up vs. top–down regulation and high productivity in marine ecosystems.},

The lecture distinguishes between explanation and prediction as modeling goals, and offers sixteen reasons other than prediction to build a model. It also challenges the common assumption that scientific theories arise from and 'summarize' data, when often, theories precede and guide data collection; without theory, in other words, it is not clear what data to collect. Among other things, it also argues that the modeling enterprise enforces habits of mind essential to freedom.  It is based on the author's 2008 Bastille Day keynote address to the Second World Congress on Social Simulation, George Mason University, and earlier addresses at the Institute of Medicine, the University of Michigan, and the Santa Fe Institute.},
