	abstract = {Use of estuaries and oceans by salmonids varies greatly, from no use in nonanadromous species, to movement toward the sea soon after hatching and emergence in some Pacific salmon. This variation is accompanied by large differences in the ontogeny of salinity tolerance among salmonids. Some species acquire increased salinity tolerance early in development, whereas others develop this characteristic much later, indicating there is a heterochrony (change in timing) in the development of salinity tolerance in salmonids. The basic physiological mechanisms for ion regulation in seawater (such as increased gill chloride cells, gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity, membrane permeability, and drinking rate) are common to all salmonids. What determines the differences in salinity tolerance among the salmonids is not the basic mechanisms for salt secretion but the environmental and ontogenetic control of these mechanisms. In salmonids such as pink and chum salmon that enter seawater soon after emergence, acclimation to seawater may be controlled largely by internal (ontogenetic) information. In smolting salmonids that acquire increased salinity tolerance 1-2 yr after hatching, photoperiod is the dominant environmental cue. In nonsmolting species that migrate 2-3 yr after hatching, salinity itself may be the primary stimulus for salt secretory mechanisms. Physiological changes triggered by developmental and environmental cues are mediated by endocrine factors. Treatments with cortisol, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor I have been shown to increase seawater tolerance of salmonids, whereas prolactin is inhibitory. Differences in developmental patterns of endocrine activity (such as secretion, binding proteins, and receptors) are hypothesized to be responsible for the differences in timing (heterochrony) of increased salinity tolerance among and within salmonid species.},

However, global changes have already profoundly altered the thermal and hydrological regimes of rivers, affecting the timing of fish migration as well as the environmental conditions under which it occurs. In this study, we focused on Atlantic salmon (
              Salmo salar
              ), an iconic diadromous species whose individuals migrate between marine nursery areas and continental spawning grounds. An innovative multivariate method was developed to analyse long-term datasets of daily water temperature, discharge and both salmon juvenile downstream and adult upstream migrations in three French rivers (the Bresle, Oir and Nivelle rivers). While all three rivers have gradually warmed over the last 35 years, changes in discharge have been very heterogeneous. Juveniles more frequently used warmer temperatures to migrate. Adults migrating a few weeks before spawning more frequently used warm temperatures associated with high discharges. This has already led to modifications in preferential niches of both life stages and suggests a potential mismatch between these populations' ecological preference and changes in their local environment due to global change.},

In this paper they track changes in available niche, changes in effective niche, and discuss potential implication of niche shift relative to preferential niche.

Choc analysis - 
daily proportion of smolts  = daily number/ total number of smolts that year
warm water was used more frequently by smolts to migrate
highest disharges were used more frequently by smolts
colder water discharges has become more scarce and warm water discharges have been more frequent recently
studies have shown that smolts respond to environemntal cues to migrate and reach the ocean when water temperatures are above 8 degree C to improve feeding conditions, salinity tolerance and swimming performance. migrating in the summer causes more energy loss. earlier migration of smolts that are smaller in size makes them more vulnerable to predation. 

Preferential niche is evolving towards warmer waters

A review of studies of the patterns and mechanisms of DSM showed that it met the main criterion for migration: that animals move between well-dened habitats according to a predictable schedule. During DSM, sh often leave the habitat in which they reside (inshore zone) and enter a migratory habitat (main channel). DSM is manifested at a seasonal or diel scale and in species-specic spatial distribution patterns. According to our “dispersal with low dilution” hypothesis, the supposed adaptive value of DSM is due not only to dispersal but also to maintenance of aggregations and synchronization of migratory activity. Temporal and spatial peaks of migration promote efcient intraspecic interactions, such as shoaling, and the integrity of populations. We conclude that migratory behaviour is most successful in habitats with optimum complexity and that the inuence of behaviour on DSM is most important at key periods and sites (twilight windows and interfaces between habitats).},

We identiﬁed six primary life histories that included two phenotypes for early migratory tactics: fry that migrated up to 140–200 km shortly after emergence (movers) and ﬁsh that reared for 8–16 months in natal areas (stayers). Peak emigration of juvenile salmon from the Willamette River was in June–July (subyearling smolts), March–May (yearling smolts), and November–December (considered as “autumn smolts”). Alternative migratory behaviors of juvenile salmon were associated with extensive use of diverse habitats that eventually encompassed up to 400 rkm of the basin, including tributaries in natal areas and large rivers. Juvenile salmon that reared in natal reaches and migrated as yearlings were the most prevalent life history and had the lowest temporal variability. However, the total productivity of the basin was increased by the contribution of ﬁsh with dispersive life histories, which represented over 50\% of the total smolt production. Life-history diversity reduced the variability in the total smolt population by 35\% over the weighted mean of individual life histories, providing evidence of a considerable portfolio effect through the asynchronous contributions of life histories. Protecting and restoring a diverse suite of connected habitats in the Willamette River basin will promote the development and expression of juvenile life histories, thereby providing stability and resilience to native salmon populations.},

	abstract = {Physiological and behavioral changes occur in the spring when juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. undergo smolting. Survival is maximized if the timing of these changes coincides with migration from fresh to marine environments. Therefore, understanding how environmental conditions influence the onset, duration, and termination of smolting can have substantial management implications, particularly for flow-controlled rivers. We used an information-theoretic model comparison analysis to investigate the roles of daily mean temperature, temperature experience (accumulated thermal units [ATU]), photoperiod, and flow on the timing of the downstream migration of Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha smolts from the Nechako River in central British Columbia. Both binary (migration or not) and count (the total number of migrants) models were developed that predicted the downstream migration of Chinook salmon based on data collected from fish captured at rotary-screw traps from 1992 to 2004. The analyses identified a combination of temperature experience, flow, and the number of spawners as best able to describe the observed migration patterns. In addition, increasing ATU had a positive influence on migration, while increasing flow had a negative influence. Temperature experience was found to have more influence on migration than daily mean temperature. The predictive ability of each model was tested with 2 years of independent data. The count model accurately predicted the general trends in migration and, in particular, the termination of migration, but not the daily fluctuations in movement. By contrast, the binary model predicted whether fish would migrate on a given day with accuracies of 93\% and 99\%, respectively, for the 2 years tested. Temperature experience was more strongly linked to migration than the daily or threshold temperature; warmer temperatures resulted in earlier migration. Our data suggest that flow plays an important role once migration is under way and may even serve as a termination cue. Furthermore, the number of migrants and the probability of migration was positively related to the number of spawners. Based on the results of this study, flow manipulations that change the timing, duration, or magnitude of temperature and flow in the spring could affect the migration of Chinook salmon. Both temperature and river flow should be considered when one is managing flow-controlled watersheds for salmon productivity.},

photoperiod was important for smolting but once smolting occured, photoperiod was not as important for migration behavior. 
previous studies (“Connor et al. 2003”) showed increased flow increases migration numbers but in this study, flow had a negative correlation with count 
migration numbers initially increases with flow but migrant numbers peaks before flow peaks and it starts decreasing before flow peaks.
ATU was more strongly linked to migration than daily temperature - warmer temperatures resulted in earlier start to migration
flow is not important for start of migration but might be important while migration is going on and for termination.
managers can send a little bit of cold water deep in the reservoir to reduce temperatures without drastically increasing flow.

	abstract = {One of the most spectacular phenomena in nature is the annual return of millions of salmon to spawn in their natal streams and lakes along the Pacific coast of North America. The salmon die after spawning, and the nutrients and energy in their bodies, derived almost entirely from marine sources, are deposited in the freshwater ecosystems. This represents a vital input to the ecosystems used as spawning grounds. Salmon-derived nutrients make up a substantial fraction of the plants and animals in aquatic and terrestrial habitats associated with healthy salmon populations. The decline of salmon numbers throughout much of their southern range in North America has prompted concern that the elimination of this “conveyor belt” of nutrients and energy may fundamentally change the productivity of these coastal freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, and consequently their ability to support wildlife, including salmon. If progress is to be made towards understanding and conserving the connection between migratory salmon and coastal ecosystems, scientists and decision-makers must explore and understand the vast temporal and spatial scales that characterize this relationship.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. Archaeological data on the long history of interaction between indigenous people and salmon have rarely been applied to conservation management. When joined with ethnohistoric records, archaeology provides an alternative conceptual view of the potential for sustainable harvests and can suggest possible social mechanisms for managing human behavior. Review of the {\textasciitilde}7,500-year-long fish bone record from two subregions of the Pacific Northwest shows remarkable stability in salmon use. As major changes in the ecological and social system occurred over this lengthy period, persistence in the fishery is not due simply to a lack of perturbation, but rather indicates resilience in the ecological–human system. Of several factors possibly contributing to resilience, low human population size and harvesting pressure, habitat enhancement, and suppression of competing predators do not appear to be of major importance. Flexible resource use, including human use of a range of local resources, many of which are linked in a food web with salmon, likely contributed to resilience. Most important were the beliefs and social institutions (including ownership, regulation, rituals, and monitoring) that placed restraints on salmon use as a common pool resource. In contrast, only a small fraction of our modern society relies economically on or has direct interaction with the fish, which limits our concern and willingness to fundamentally change behaviors that contribute to habitat degradation and loss, the main challenges facing salmon populations today. Salmon recovery efforts may benefit substantially from investing more resources into establishing links between community groups and actual fish populations, which would create a sense of proprietorship, one of the keys to resilience in the indigenous salmon fishery.},

	abstract = {The anadromous life cycle of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar involves long migrations to novel environments and challenging physiological transformations when moving between salt-free and salt-rich waters. In this article, (1) environmental factors affecting the migration behaviour and survival of smolts and post-smolts during the river, estuarine and early marine phases, (2) how behavioural patterns are linked to survival and (3) how anthropogenic factors affect migration and survival are synthesized and reviewed based on published literature. The timing of the smolt migration is important in determining marine survival. The timing varies among rivers, most likely as a consequence of local adaptations, to ensure sea entry during optimal periods. Smolts and post-smolts swim actively and fast during migration, but in areas with strong currents, their own movements may be overridden by current-induced transport. Progression rates during the early marine migration vary between 0·4 and 3·0 body lengths s−1 relative to the ground. Reported mortality is 0·3–7·0\% (median 2·3) km−1 during downriver migration, 0·6–36\% (median 6·0) km−1 in estuaries and 0·3–3·4\% (median 1·4) km−1 in coastal areas. Estuaries and river mouths are the sites of the highest mortalities, with predation being a common cause. The mortality rates varied more among studies in estuaries than in rivers and marine areas, which probably reflects the huge variation among estuaries in their characteristics. Behaviour and survival during migration may also be affected by pollution, fish farming, sea lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis, hydropower development and other anthropogenic activities that may be directly lethal, delay migration or have indirect effects by inhibiting migration. Total mortality reported during early marine migration (up to 5–230 km from the river mouths) in the studies available to date varies between 8 and 71\%. Hence, the early marine migration is a life stage with high mortalities, due to both natural and human influences. Factors affecting mortality during the smolt and post-smolt stages contribute to determine the abundance of spawner returns. With many S. salar populations in decline, increased mortality at these stages may considerably contribute to limit S. salar production, and the consequences of human-induced mortality at this stage may be severe. Development of management actions to increase survival and fitness at the smolt and post-smolt stages is crucial to re-establish or conserve wild populations.},

Smolting includes increased salinity tolerance, increased metabolism, downstream migratory and schooling behavior, silvering and darkened ﬁn margins, and olfactory imprinting. These changes are promoted by growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor I, cortisol, thyroid hormones, whereas prolactin is inhibitory. Photoperiod and temperature are critical environmental cues for smolt development, and their relative importance will be critical in determining responses to future climate change. Most of our knowledge of the environmental control and endocrine mediation of smolting is based on laboratory and hatchery studies, yet there is emerging information on ﬁsh in the wild that indicates substantial differences. Such differences may arise from differences in environmental stimuli in artiﬁcial rearing environments, and may be critical to ocean survival and population sustainability.

migrating downstream decreased significantly from an annual mean of 11 579 in the 1970s to a

consistent decline in the number of returning adults from the 1970s until the mid 1990s. Timing
of the smolt migrations (runs) was consistent throughout the three decades. The mean
durations of the smolt runs were 1021, 926 and 1032 days for the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s

We studied relationships between the time of smolt migration, water temperature and light intensity for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and sea trout (Salmo trutta). During 2006–2012, migrating smolts descending the southern Norway River Storelva were caught in a rotary screw trap located at the river mouth. The date of 50\% cumulative smolt descent correlated significantly with the date when the river temperature exceeded 8°C for both Atlantic salmon and sea trout smolts. In 2010, smolts of both species were passive integrated transponder (PIT)-­tagged, and the diel timing of their migration was precisely documented. The degree of night migration decreased in both species as the river temperature rose, and at temperatures above 12–13°C, more smolts migrated during day than during night. A multinomial model was fitted for estimating temperature and species effects on probabilities of migration during night, daytime, dusk and dawn. Atlantic salmon smolts preferred migrating under lower light intensities than sea trout smolts during early, but not late spring when both species migrated during bright daylight. In accordance with the early-­season tendency to migrate at night, Atlantic salmon smolts migrated more during darker hours of the day than sea trout. In both species, smaller smolts migrated under dark conditions than during light conditions. Most of the findings on thermal, light and temporal effects on the observed smolt migration pattern can be explained as adaptations to predation avoidance.},

	abstract = {Since the late 1980s, studies of smolt emigration patterns in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar have been conducted in three Icelandic rivers: Ellidaar in the southwest, Nupsa (tributary of the Midfjardara River) in the northwest, and Vesturdalsa in the northeast. Migration time in the southwest was from mid-May to mid-June, but in the two northern rivers it was from midJune to early August. The smolts in all three rivers migrated mainly at low light intensity: at night early in the summer or early in the day late in the summer. There was signiﬁcant correlation between the onset of the smolt emigration and the water temperature. Increased ﬂow, which in the south was associated with warm southerly winds and rain, stimulated the smolt run in the Ellidaar River but depressed the run in the north, where cold northerly wind brought predominantly snow. In cold summers in the Vesturdalsa River, smolt emigration was delayed until August, when the smolts reached a larger size. Fewer smolts emigrated in the colder years. The smolt run in the northern rivers coincided with a narrow range in sea surface temperatures in spite of wide range in emigration time. The return ratio of the smolts varied among years and was generally higher in the Ellidaar River (average, 7.9\%) than in the Nupsa (2.4\%) and Vesturdalsa rivers (2.7\%). We suggest that northern Iceland smolts have adapted to unstable environmental conditions and thereby use environmental cues (e.g., river water temperatures) to guide them to the most favorable conditions in the sea.},

The modeled relationships were indistinguishable from laboratory models that predicted time to maximum alevin wet weight. Variability in stream temperatures during the spring accounted for 60\% of the variability in the median date of coho smolt emigration.

For smolts in Deer and Flynn creeks, Oregon (1960–1972), migration probability was inﬂuenced by numerous factors, including photoperiod, temperature (absolute and change), ﬂow (absolute and change), and lunar phase, with certain factors interacting. Smolts from Carnation Creek, British Columbia (1972–1986) responded to a similarly diverse suite of factors (excluding lunar phase), though in somewhat different ways.

Prior to each release a portion of the juveniles in each pond were graded into three size groups (small, medium, large) based on size distributions in each pond. The juveniles were nose-tagged according to size group, pond, and release date, and marked by adipose fin removal. A total of 57 groups were released. Returns of adults and precocious males (jacks) to the weir and to the fishery (commercial, sport) were subjected to response surface analysis. Maximum adult returns of 43.5\%, to the weir and fishery, were predicted for release of 25.1-g coho juveniles on the 173rd (Julian) day from January 1 (June 22, 1975). A significant interaction was noted between release time and size: maximum returns from early (April 14) releases would be expected from release of 16- to 17-g juveniles. Returns of jacks from the six ponds ranged from 0.0 to 4.65\%. Predicted returns of jacks would be maximized from early release of large juveniles ({\textgreater} {\textasciitilde}20 g in April). The benefit–cost ratio at the center of the time and size of release surface for maximum adult returns was estimated as 12.2:1. Maximum benefit–cost ratios were calculated for release of smaller juveniles between June 17 and 22, 1975. Benefit–costs associated with releases on the path of joint optimality between the two response centers rose from 12.2:1 (maximum adult returns) to a calculated 16.5:1 for release of 7.5-g juveniles on June 17, 1975. Size and time at juvenile release and success of adult returns are viewed as initial and final aspects of a biological system whose central components as yet are imperfectly understood.

	abstract = {The American Fisheries Society herein provides a list of depleted Pacific salmon, steelhead, and sea-run cutthroat stocks from California, Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, to accompany the list of rare inland fishes reported by Williams et al. (1989). The list includes 214 native naturally-spawning stocks: 101 at high risk of extinction, 58 at moderate risk of extinction, 54 of special concern, and one classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and as endangered by the state of California. The decline in native salmon, steelhead, and sea-run cutthroat populations has resulted from habitat loss and damage, and inadequate passage and flows caused by hydropower, agriculture, logging, and other developments; overfishing, primarily of weaker stocks in mixed-stock fisheries; and negative interactions with other fishes, including nonnative hatchery salmon and steelhead. While some attempts at remedying these threats have been made, they have not been enough to prevent the broad decline of stocks along the West Coast. A new paradigm that advances habitat restoration and ecosystem function rather than hatchery production is needed for many of these stocks to survive and prosper into the next century.},

	abstract = {Clear-cut logging of 41\% of the basin of Carnation Creek, British Columbia, resulted in increased stream temperatures in all months of the year, increases above prelogging temperatures ranged from 0.7 °C in December to 3.2 °C in August. Earlier emergence of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) fry associated with the temperature increases lengthened their summer growing season by up to 6 wk. Fingerlings were significantly larger by the fall in the years after logging compared with the years before logging. The increased size of fingerlings was associated with improved overwinter survival. Following logging, yearling smolt numbers doubled, although 2-yr-old smolt numbers decreased. Warmer spring temperatures were also associated with earlier seaward migration of smolts, probably resulting in decreased smolt-to-aduit survivals. A linked series of models that first predict logging effects on stream temperatures and then the effects of those temperatures on critical coho life history events are developed. The life history model is used to quantify the effects of stream temperature changes related to logging on the population size of adult coho salmon. The predicted effect of those temperature changes was a 9\% increase in adult coho numbers prior to the fishery, an increase considerably less than the observed 47\% increase in smolt numbers.},
