	abstract = {Use of estuaries and oceans by salmonids varies greatly, from no use in nonanadromous species, to movement toward the sea soon after hatching and emergence in some Pacific salmon. This variation is accompanied by large differences in the ontogeny of salinity tolerance among salmonids. Some species acquire increased salinity tolerance early in development, whereas others develop this characteristic much later, indicating there is a heterochrony (change in timing) in the development of salinity tolerance in salmonids. The basic physiological mechanisms for ion regulation in seawater (such as increased gill chloride cells, gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity, membrane permeability, and drinking rate) are common to all salmonids. What determines the differences in salinity tolerance among the salmonids is not the basic mechanisms for salt secretion but the environmental and ontogenetic control of these mechanisms. In salmonids such as pink and chum salmon that enter seawater soon after emergence, acclimation to seawater may be controlled largely by internal (ontogenetic) information. In smolting salmonids that acquire increased salinity tolerance 1-2 yr after hatching, photoperiod is the dominant environmental cue. In nonsmolting species that migrate 2-3 yr after hatching, salinity itself may be the primary stimulus for salt secretory mechanisms. Physiological changes triggered by developmental and environmental cues are mediated by endocrine factors. Treatments with cortisol, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor I have been shown to increase seawater tolerance of salmonids, whereas prolactin is inhibitory. Differences in developmental patterns of endocrine activity (such as secretion, binding proteins, and receptors) are hypothesized to be responsible for the differences in timing (heterochrony) of increased salinity tolerance among and within salmonid species.},

However, global changes have already profoundly altered the thermal and hydrological regimes of rivers, affecting the timing of fish migration as well as the environmental conditions under which it occurs. In this study, we focused on Atlantic salmon (
              Salmo salar
              ), an iconic diadromous species whose individuals migrate between marine nursery areas and continental spawning grounds. An innovative multivariate method was developed to analyse long-term datasets of daily water temperature, discharge and both salmon juvenile downstream and adult upstream migrations in three French rivers (the Bresle, Oir and Nivelle rivers). While all three rivers have gradually warmed over the last 35 years, changes in discharge have been very heterogeneous. Juveniles more frequently used warmer temperatures to migrate. Adults migrating a few weeks before spawning more frequently used warm temperatures associated with high discharges. This has already led to modifications in preferential niches of both life stages and suggests a potential mismatch between these populations' ecological preference and changes in their local environment due to global change.},

In this paper they track changes in available niche, changes in effective niche, and discuss potential implication of niche shift relative to preferential niche.

Choc analysis - 
daily proportion of smolts  = daily number/ total number of smolts that year
warm water was used more frequently by smolts to migrate
highest disharges were used more frequently by smolts
colder water discharges has become more scarce and warm water discharges have been more frequent recently
studies have shown that smolts respond to environemntal cues to migrate and reach the ocean when water temperatures are above 8 degree C to improve feeding conditions, salinity tolerance and swimming performance. migrating in the summer causes more energy loss. earlier migration of smolts that are smaller in size makes them more vulnerable to predation. 

Preferential niche is evolving towards warmer waters

During DSM, sh often leave the habitat in which they reside (inshore zone) and enter a migratory habitat (main channel). DSM is manifested at a seasonal or diel scale and in species-specic spatial distribution patterns. According to our “dispersal with low dilution” hypothesis, the supposed adaptive value of DSM is due not only to dispersal but also to maintenance of aggregations and synchronization of migratory activity. Temporal and spatial peaks of migration promote efcient intraspecic interactions, such as shoaling, and the integrity of populations. We conclude that migratory behaviour is most successful in habitats with optimum complexity and that the inuence of behaviour on DSM is most important at key periods and sites (twilight windows and interfaces between habitats).},

We identiﬁed six primary life histories that included two phenotypes for early migratory tactics: fry that migrated up to 140–200 km shortly after emergence (movers) and ﬁsh that reared for 8–16 months in natal areas (stayers). Peak emigration of juvenile salmon from the Willamette River was in June–July (subyearling smolts), March–May (yearling smolts), and November–December (considered as “autumn smolts”). Alternative migratory behaviors of juvenile salmon were associated with extensive use of diverse habitats that eventually encompassed up to 400 rkm of the basin, including tributaries in natal areas and large rivers. Juvenile salmon that reared in natal reaches and migrated as yearlings were the most prevalent life history and had the lowest temporal variability. However, the total productivity of the basin was increased by the contribution of ﬁsh with dispersive life histories, which represented over 50\% of the total smolt production. Life-history diversity reduced the variability in the total smolt population by 35\% over the weighted mean of individual life histories, providing evidence of a considerable portfolio effect through the asynchronous contributions of life histories. Protecting and restoring a diverse suite of connected habitats in the Willamette River basin will promote the development and expression of juvenile life histories, thereby providing stability and resilience to native salmon populations.},

	abstract = {Physiological and behavioral changes occur in the spring when juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. undergo smolting. Survival is maximized if the timing of these changes coincides with migration from fresh to marine environments. Therefore, understanding how environmental conditions influence the onset, duration, and termination of smolting can have substantial management implications, particularly for flow-controlled rivers. We used an information-theoretic model comparison analysis to investigate the roles of daily mean temperature, temperature experience (accumulated thermal units [ATU]), photoperiod, and flow on the timing of the downstream migration of Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha smolts from the Nechako River in central British Columbia. Both binary (migration or not) and count (the total number of migrants) models were developed that predicted the downstream migration of Chinook salmon based on data collected from fish captured at rotary-screw traps from 1992 to 2004. The analyses identified a combination of temperature experience, flow, and the number of spawners as best able to describe the observed migration patterns. In addition, increasing ATU had a positive influence on migration, while increasing flow had a negative influence. Temperature experience was found to have more influence on migration than daily mean temperature. The predictive ability of each model was tested with 2 years of independent data. The count model accurately predicted the general trends in migration and, in particular, the termination of migration, but not the daily fluctuations in movement. By contrast, the binary model predicted whether fish would migrate on a given day with accuracies of 93\% and 99\%, respectively, for the 2 years tested. Temperature experience was more strongly linked to migration than the daily or threshold temperature; warmer temperatures resulted in earlier migration. Our data suggest that flow plays an important role once migration is under way and may even serve as a termination cue. Furthermore, the number of migrants and the probability of migration was positively related to the number of spawners. Based on the results of this study, flow manipulations that change the timing, duration, or magnitude of temperature and flow in the spring could affect the migration of Chinook salmon. Both temperature and river flow should be considered when one is managing flow-controlled watersheds for salmon productivity.},

photoperiod was important for smolting but once smolting occured, photoperiod was not as important for migration behavior. 
previous studies (“Connor et al. 2003”) showed increased flow increases migration numbers but in this study, flow had a negative correlation with count 
migration numbers initially increases with flow but migrant numbers peaks before flow peaks and it starts decreasing before flow peaks.
ATU was more strongly linked to migration than daily temperature - warmer temperatures resulted in earlier start to migration
flow is not important for start of migration but might be important while migration is going on and for termination.
managers can send a little bit of cold water deep in the reservoir to reduce temperatures without drastically increasing flow.

The salmon die after spawning, and the nutrients and energy in their bodies, derived almost entirely from marine sources, are deposited in the freshwater ecosystems. This represents a vital input to the ecosystems used as spawning grounds. Salmon-derived nutrients make up a substantial fraction of the plants and animals in aquatic and terrestrial habitats associated with healthy salmon populations. The decline of salmon numbers throughout much of their southern range in North America has prompted concern that the elimination of this “conveyor belt” of nutrients and energy may fundamentally change the productivity of these coastal freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, and consequently their ability to support wildlife, including salmon. If progress is to be made towards understanding and conserving the connection between migratory salmon and coastal ecosystems, scientists and decision-makers must explore and understand the vast temporal and spatial scales that characterize this relationship.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. Archaeological data on the long history of interaction between indigenous people and salmon have rarely been applied to conservation management. When joined with ethnohistoric records, archaeology provides an alternative conceptual view of the potential for sustainable harvests and can suggest possible social mechanisms for managing human behavior. Review of the {\textasciitilde}7,500-year-long fish bone record from two subregions of the Pacific Northwest shows remarkable stability in salmon use. As major changes in the ecological and social system occurred over this lengthy period, persistence in the fishery is not due simply to a lack of perturbation, but rather indicates resilience in the ecological–human system. Of several factors possibly contributing to resilience, low human population size and harvesting pressure, habitat enhancement, and suppression of competing predators do not appear to be of major importance. Flexible resource use, including human use of a range of local resources, many of which are linked in a food web with salmon, likely contributed to resilience. Most important were the beliefs and social institutions (including ownership, regulation, rituals, and monitoring) that placed restraints on salmon use as a common pool resource. In contrast, only a small fraction of our modern society relies economically on or has direct interaction with the fish, which limits our concern and willingness to fundamentally change behaviors that contribute to habitat degradation and loss, the main challenges facing salmon populations today. Salmon recovery efforts may benefit substantially from investing more resources into establishing links between community groups and actual fish populations, which would create a sense of proprietorship, one of the keys to resilience in the indigenous salmon fishery.},

	abstract = {The anadromous life cycle of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar involves long migrations to novel environments and challenging physiological transformations when moving between salt-free and salt-rich waters. In this article, (1) environmental factors affecting the migration behaviour and survival of smolts and post-smolts during the river, estuarine and early marine phases, (2) how behavioural patterns are linked to survival and (3) how anthropogenic factors affect migration and survival are synthesized and reviewed based on published literature. The timing of the smolt migration is important in determining marine survival. The timing varies among rivers, most likely as a consequence of local adaptations, to ensure sea entry during optimal periods. Smolts and post-smolts swim actively and fast during migration, but in areas with strong currents, their own movements may be overridden by current-induced transport. Progression rates during the early marine migration vary between 0·4 and 3·0 body lengths s−1 relative to the ground. Reported mortality is 0·3–7·0\% (median 2·3) km−1 during downriver migration, 0·6–36\% (median 6·0) km−1 in estuaries and 0·3–3·4\% (median 1·4) km−1 in coastal areas. Estuaries and river mouths are the sites of the highest mortalities, with predation being a common cause. The mortality rates varied more among studies in estuaries than in rivers and marine areas, which probably reflects the huge variation among estuaries in their characteristics. Behaviour and survival during migration may also be affected by pollution, fish farming, sea lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis, hydropower development and other anthropogenic activities that may be directly lethal, delay migration or have indirect effects by inhibiting migration. Total mortality reported during early marine migration (up to 5–230 km from the river mouths) in the studies available to date varies between 8 and 71\%. Hence, the early marine migration is a life stage with high mortalities, due to both natural and human influences. Factors affecting mortality during the smolt and post-smolt stages contribute to determine the abundance of spawner returns. With many S. salar populations in decline, increased mortality at these stages may considerably contribute to limit S. salar production, and the consequences of human-induced mortality at this stage may be severe. Development of management actions to increase survival and fitness at the smolt and post-smolt stages is crucial to re-establish or conserve wild populations.},

Most of our knowledge of the environmental control and endocrine mediation of smolting is based on laboratory and hatchery studies, yet there is emerging information on ﬁsh in the wild that indicates substantial differences. Such differences may arise from differences in environmental stimuli in artiﬁcial rearing environments, and may be critical to ocean survival and population sustainability.

migrating downstream decreased significantly from an annual mean of 11 579 in the 1970s to a

of the smolt migrations (runs) was consistent throughout the three decades. The mean

We studied relationships between the time of smolt migration, water temperature and light intensity for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and sea trout (Salmo trutta). During 2006–2012, migrating smolts descending the southern Norway River Storelva were caught in a rotary screw trap located at the river mouth. The date of 50\% cumulative smolt descent correlated significantly with the date when the river temperature exceeded 8°C for both Atlantic salmon and sea trout smolts. In 2010, smolts of both species were passive integrated transponder (PIT)-­tagged, and the diel timing of their migration was precisely documented. The degree of night migration decreased in both species as the river temperature rose, and at temperatures above 12–13°C, more smolts migrated during day than during night. A multinomial model was fitted for estimating temperature and species effects on probabilities of migration during night, daytime, dusk and dawn. Atlantic salmon smolts preferred migrating under lower light intensities than sea trout smolts during early, but not late spring when both species migrated during bright daylight. In accordance with the early-­season tendency to migrate at night, Atlantic salmon smolts migrated more during darker hours of the day than sea trout. In both species, smaller smolts migrated under dark conditions than during light conditions. Most of the findings on thermal, light and temporal effects on the observed smolt migration pattern can be explained as adaptations to predation avoidance.},

	abstract = {Since the late 1980s, studies of smolt emigration patterns in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar have been conducted in three Icelandic rivers: Ellidaar in the southwest, Nupsa (tributary of the Midfjardara River) in the northwest, and Vesturdalsa in the northeast. Migration time in the southwest was from mid-May to mid-June, but in the two northern rivers it was from midJune to early August. The smolts in all three rivers migrated mainly at low light intensity: at night early in the summer or early in the day late in the summer. There was signiﬁcant correlation between the onset of the smolt emigration and the water temperature. Increased ﬂow, which in the south was associated with warm southerly winds and rain, stimulated the smolt run in the Ellidaar River but depressed the run in the north, where cold northerly wind brought predominantly snow. In cold summers in the Vesturdalsa River, smolt emigration was delayed until August, when the smolts reached a larger size. Fewer smolts emigrated in the colder years. The smolt run in the northern rivers coincided with a narrow range in sea surface temperatures in spite of wide range in emigration time. The return ratio of the smolts varied among years and was generally higher in the Ellidaar River (average, 7.9\%) than in the Nupsa (2.4\%) and Vesturdalsa rivers (2.7\%). We suggest that northern Iceland smolts have adapted to unstable environmental conditions and thereby use environmental cues (e.g., river water temperatures) to guide them to the most favorable conditions in the sea.},

The modeled relationships were indistinguishable from laboratory models that predicted time to maximum alevin wet weight.

For smolts in Deer and Flynn creeks, Oregon (1960–1972), migration probability was inﬂuenced by numerous factors, including photoperiod, temperature (absolute and change), ﬂow (absolute and change), and lunar phase, with certain factors interacting. Smolts from Carnation Creek, British Columbia (1972–1986) responded to a similarly diverse suite of factors (excluding lunar phase), though in somewhat different ways. In contrast, migration timing of smolts in Sashin Creek, Alaska (1959–1969) was best explained by a model that included only photoperiod, temperature, and the interaction between these terms.

Prior to each release a portion of the juveniles in each pond were graded into three size groups (small, medium, large) based on size distributions in each pond. The juveniles were nose-tagged according to size group, pond, and release date, and marked by adipose fin removal. A total of 57 groups were released. Returns of adults and precocious males (jacks) to the weir and to the fishery (commercial, sport) were subjected to response surface analysis. Maximum adult returns of 43.5\%, to the weir and fishery, were predicted for release of 25.1-g coho juveniles on the 173rd (Julian) day from January 1 (June 22, 1975). A significant interaction was noted between release time and size: maximum returns from early (April 14) releases would be expected from release of 16- to 17-g juveniles. Returns of jacks from the six ponds ranged from 0.0 to 4.65\%. Predicted returns of jacks would be maximized from early release of large juveniles ({\textgreater} {\textasciitilde}20 g in April). The benefit–cost ratio at the center of the time and size of release surface for maximum adult returns was estimated as 12.2:1. Maximum benefit–cost ratios were calculated for release of smaller juveniles between June 17 and 22, 1975. Benefit–costs associated with releases on the path of joint optimality between the two response centers rose from 12.2:1 (maximum adult returns) to a calculated 16.5:1 for release of 7.5-g juveniles on June 17, 1975. Size and time at juvenile release and success of adult returns are viewed as initial and final aspects of a biological system whose central components as yet are imperfectly understood.

The decline in native salmon, steelhead, and sea-run cutthroat populations has resulted from habitat loss and damage, and inadequate passage and flows caused by hydropower, agriculture, logging, and other developments; overfishing, primarily of weaker stocks in mixed-stock fisheries; and negative interactions with other fishes, including nonnative hatchery salmon and steelhead. While some attempts at remedying these threats have been made, they have not been enough to prevent the broad decline of stocks along the West Coast. A new paradigm that advances habitat restoration and ecosystem function rather than hatchery production is needed for many of these stocks to survive and prosper into the next century.},

Earlier emergence of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) fry associated with the temperature increases lengthened their summer growing season by up to 6 wk. Fingerlings were significantly larger by the fall in the years after logging compared with the years before logging. The increased size of fingerlings was associated with improved overwinter survival. Following logging, yearling smolt numbers doubled, although 2-yr-old smolt numbers decreased. Warmer spring temperatures were also associated with earlier seaward migration of smolts, probably resulting in decreased smolt-to-aduit survivals. A linked series of models that first predict logging effects on stream temperatures and then the effects of those temperatures on critical coho life history events are developed. The life history model is used to quantify the effects of stream temperature changes related to logging on the population size of adult coho salmon. The predicted effect of those temperature changes was a 9\% increase in adult coho numbers prior to the fishery, an increase considerably less than the observed 47\% increase in smolt numbers.},

These declines combined with current overfishing, habitat degradation, and pollution paint a grim picture for the future of marine fisheries and ecosystems. However, current models forecasting such declines do not account for the effects of ocean fronts as biogeochemical hotspots. Here we apply a fundamental technique from fluid dynamics to an ecosystem model to show how fronts increase total ecosystem biomass, explain fishery production, cause regime shifts, and contribute significantly to global biogeochemical budgets by channeling nutrients through alternate trophic pathways. We then illustrate how ocean fronts affect fishery abundance and yield, using long-term records of anchovy–sardine regimes and salmon abundances in the California Current. These results elucidate the fundamental importance of biophysical coupling as a driver of bottom–up vs. top–down regulation and high productivity in marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Spatial patchiness of plankton enhances fishery production and carbon export in the ocean. While diel vertical migration (DVM) has been identified as an important factor contributing to vertical patchiness, its effect on horizontal patchiness has never been investigated. We use a simple individual-based zooplankton model to examine the effect of DVM on the horizontal patchiness of four zooplankton groups with differing DVM patterns in a two-dimensional ocean circulation model. We find that zooplankton horizontal patchiness can be induced by two mechanisms: (1) in stratified waters, DVM can synchronize zooplankton vertical positions with the horizontal current velocities that drive them, resulting in horizontal patchiness; and (2) migrating zooplankton tend to aggregate in deep waters when they encounter sea bottom. Due to these mechanisms, zooplankton horizontal patchiness may be ubiquitous in the ocean, enhancing secondary production and fisheries.},

This paper (Chen et al.) hypothesizes that DVM alone is required for horizontal patchiness.
They argue that because of gradients in horizontal current velocity, synchronized vertical positions (?) would lead to aggregations 
“We find that both DVM and the seamount can induce horizontal patchiness, via distinct mechanisms.” (Chen et al., 2021, p. 124)

“The third limitation is the difficulty of completely separating the effects on patchiness of bathymetry and DVM, respectively. One possibility would be to modify the bathymetry to examine the effect of bathymetry on zooplankton patchiness. However, the problem is that the patterns of ocean currents depend on bathymetry. We also tried to compare the patterns of zooplankton patchiness in the three different segments with different bathymetry. However, a similar problem remains: the ocean currents differ among the segments. However, while it is nearly impossible to completely separate these two effects, we can infer from our results that bathymetry and DVM each independently affect zooplankton horizontal patchiness, as discussed below.” (Chen et al., 2021, p. 131)

“Spatial patchiness is an important factor contributing to productivity (Woodson and Litvin 2015). Since water column stratification and seamounts can promote zooplankton patchiness, these two factors should also enhance secondary production and fisheries. It has been observed that aggregations of migrating zooplankton trapped within the trough of seamounts may attract predatory fish and become feeding hotspots for marine fish near seamounts (Genin et al.1988, 1994). Seamounts have been already reported as important sites for enhanced productivity and fisheries because of enhanced nutrient supply via N2 fixation or upwelling (Hasegawa et al. 2008, 2009; Shiozaki et al. 2014). This study provides evidence that seamounts can also enhance secondary production by promoting zooplankton patchiness.” (Chen et al., 2021, p. 133)

Active export of particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) due to defecation at depth has rarely been considered in export budgets. We measured the gut passage time (GPT) of common migrant species at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site, using the gut fluorescence method, to determine whether GPT is slow enough to allow active export of POC and PON to depth. Mean GPT for the copepods Pleuromamma xiphias and Euchirella messinensis was 191 and 114 min, respectively, and for the euphausiids Thysanopoda aequalis and Euphausia brevis (analyzed together) was 41 min, exceeding previously reported GPT for nonmigrating zooplankton by a factor of 6. Between 18 and 81\% of the initial gut pigment was retained in zooplankton guts upon descent below a mixed layer of 150 m. By comparing pigment ingestion rates (gut fluorescence technique) with total ingestion rates (CHN analysis of fecal material), we estimated that 71 to 85\% of the migrant diet originated from non-plant material, which we included in our estimates of active POC/PON export. We applied the mean weight-specific active POC/PON export rate for the species examined to the total migratory zooplankton biomass using data from the BATS zooplankton time-series. Mean active POC (PON) flux at BATS was 0.94 mg C m–2 d–1 (0.18 mg N m–2 d–1) and the maximum was 5.27 mg C m–2 d–1 (1.02 mg N m–2 d–1), corresponding to a mean of 3\% (4\%) and a maximum of 18\% (20\%) of the mean gravitational POC (PON) flux measured by sediment traps at 150 m. Migrants also contributed significantly to passive flux via production of sinking fecal pellets during the night in surface waters. This passive flux exceeded active POC flux by {\textasciitilde}10-fold. Freshly released feces by migrators at depth could be a valuable food source for mesopelagic organisms, in contrast to feces produced in surface waters which decompose while settling through the water column.},

The normal pattern involves movement from shallow depths at night to greater depths during the day. For many herbivorous and omnivorous mesozooplankton that feed predominantly near the surface on phytoplankton and microzooplankton, minimising the risk of predation from ﬁsh seems to be the ultimate factor behind DVM. These migrants appear to use deep water as a dark daytime refuge where their probability of being detected and eaten is lower than if they remained near the surface. Associated with these vertical movements of mesozooplankton, predators at higher trophic levels, including invertebrates, ﬁsh, marine mammals, birds and reptiles, may modify their behaviour to optimise the exploitation of their vertically migrating prey. Recent advances in biotelemetry promise to allow the interaction between migrating zooplankton and diving air-breathing vertebrates to be explored in far more detail than hitherto.},

	abstract = {Animal migration plays a central role in many ecological and evolutionary processes, yet migratory populations worldwide are increasingly threatened. Adjusting migration timing to match ecosystem phenology is key to survival in dynamic and changing ecosystems, especially in an era of human-induced rapid environmental change. Social cues are increasingly recognized as major components of migratory behaviour, yet a comprehensive understanding of how social cues influence the timing of animal migrations remains elusive. Here, we introduce a framework for assessing the role that social cues, ranging from explicit (for example, active cueing) to implicit (for example, competition), play in animals’ temporal migration decisions across a range of scales. By applying this theoretical lens to a systematic review of published literature, we show that a broad range of social cues frequently mediate migration timing at a range of temporal scales and across highly diverse migratory taxa. We further highlight that while rarely documented, several social cue mechanisms (for example, social learning and density dependency) play important adaptive roles in matching migration timing with ecosystem dynamics. Thus, social cues play a fundamental role in migration timing, with potentially widespread ecological consequences and implications for the conservation of migratory species. Furthermore, our analysis establishes a theoretical basis on which to evaluate future findings on the role of both conspecific and interspecific social cues in this intersection of behavioural ecology and global change biology.},

	abstract = {Mass migrations are found throughout the animal kingdom and are often undertaken by coordinated social groups. However, surprisingly little is known about how social interactions influence migratory timing. Anadromous fishes such as salmon make extensive breeding migrations between marine and freshwater ecosystems. Returning adult salmon tend to move in discrete temporal pulses, which are typically thought to be triggered by abiotic environmental stimuli (e.g. changes in river flow or temperature). However, most studies reveal only weak correlations between abiotic factors and the timing of spawning runs. Here, we demonstrate that social interactions provide a plausible alternative or additional explanation for such patterns. We first provide an example of the phenomenon using 20 years of data on sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, ascending a stream in pulses in the absence of any obvious environmental triggers. Next, we present a model that reproduces the pulses observed in the data, simply by including social interactions among individuals. Deviations between the empirical data and the social model results suggest that salmon may alter their individual behaviour in response to annual fluctuations in density. We hope our results, demonstrating the role that social influence can play on migration timing, will motivate further studies exploring how social interactions may shape the movements of other migratory taxa. Understanding how individuals integrate social information with internal and exogenous drivers of migratory behaviour is vital, particularly in the face of a changing climate, which is changing both the cues used for, and the optimal timing of, migrations.},

They used cumulative counts of salmon because data had missing days where counts did not occur. The subsequent days counted all fish until that point (but would that cause pulses in the data even if there were no pulses of salmon coming?)

They calculated the day at which 50\% of the salmon had arrived, tau.

They set tau to be 200.

Using passive integrated transponder tags and instream readers installed near tidewater, we examined the migration, growth, and survival of 18,642 juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch in two small western Washington rivers from 2005 to 2009. In most years, more than 50\% of the juvenile coho salmon from a given brood year migrated to sea between 1 October and 31 December (fall migrants). These fall migrants were signiﬁcantly smaller at tagging than ﬁsh that migrated between 1 January and 30 June (spring migrants) but were similar in size to ﬁsh that were never detected after tagging and assumed to have died. Annual coho salmon survival estimates from tagging to out-migration ranged from 31\% to 40\% for fall and spring migrants combined but from 5\% to 15\% for spring migrants only. The best ﬁtting regression models indicated that survival differed by river and year and was negatively correlated with tagging location (river kilometer) and positively correlated with ﬁsh length: larger ﬁsh and those tagged lower in the watershed were more likely to survive. The number of days juvenile coho salmon spent in freshwater before migrating to sea was positively correlated with tagging location, ﬁsh length (mm), and habitat depth (m) and negatively with density (coho salmon/m2). Our results suggest that fall or early winter migration is a common life history for juvenile coho salmon that is driven in part by ﬁsh size and location in the watershed. The exclusion of fall migrants may lead to underestimates of the total number of migrants and parr-to-smolt survival.},

For this purpose the fish assemblage was sampled by means of stratified horizontal midwater tows at three bathymetrically defined stations: plateau (water depth {\textless} 500 m), slope (depth 500 to 1000 m) and oceanic realm (depth {\textgreater} 2300 m). The results show reduced mesopelagic fish densities, species numbers and diversity above the flanks of Atlantis Seamount and Great Meteor Seamount compared to the surrounding oceanic deep water. Multivariate statistical analysis supplied no evidence for the existence of a seamount-associated mesopelagic community at either of the two study areas. Mesopelagic fish assemblages sampled above the seamount slopes are best described as a “thinned-out oceanic community”. A total lack of mesopelagic fish species was typical above the plateaus of both seamounts. Truncation of the vertical migration range by shallow bottom topography and enhanced predation by benthopelagic species are thought to be the main reasons for the observed gaps in mesopelagic fish abundance above the plateaus of both seamounts.},

To untangle these biophysical processes we explore factors influencing the distribution of epi- and meso-pelagic (0–1000m) micronektonic crustaceans ({\textgreater}15mm; order Lophogastridea, family Gnathophausiidea; and order Decapoda) on and off seamounts along the South West Indian Ridge (SWIR, 27° to 42°S) and on a seamount off the Madagascar Ridge (31.6°S, 42.8°E). Thirty-one species of micronektic crustaceans were caught using mid-water trawls within the study area but there was no apparent latitude-related patterns in species richness or abundance. Species richness predicted by rarefraction curves and numerical abundance was highest in the vicinity ({\textless}1km) of seamounts (species richness: 15 to 21; abundance: 10±2 to 20±1 ind.10−3m−1) compared with over the abyssal plains and ridge slopes (species richness: 9.2–9.9; abundance: 24±2 to 79±8 ind.10−3m−1). Multivariate analysis of assemblage composition revealed significant groupings of individual trawl samples with respect to whether the sample was on or off a seamount and hydrographic region, but not with time of sampling relative to diel cycle (day/night or dawn) or depth of sampling (0–500, 500–800, {\textgreater}800m). The dominant species assemblage comprised the shrimps Systellaspis debilis (37\%) and Sergia prehensilis (34\%), and was restricted to seamounts on the subtropical SWIR. Our observations suggest that the ‘oasis effect’ of seamounts conventionally associated with higher trophic levels is also applicable to pelagic micronektic crustaceans at lower trophic levels. We suggest that the enhanced biomass and species richness attributed is due to ‘habitat enrichment’, whereby seamounts provide favourable habitats for both pelagic and bentho-pelagic mid-water crustaceans.},

In iteroparous anadromous species, identifying the migration cues that influence the timing of entry into freshwater, and annual variability in these timings, is important in assessing the extent of individual repeatability. Here, passive acoustic telemetry tracked 71 twaite shad Alosa fallax (‘shad’) returning to the River Severn’s upper estuary over successive spawning seasons, providing individual information on river entry timing and the associated migration cues. The timing of shad returning to the river (defined as their first detection on an acoustic receiver in the upper estuary) was consistent between years and strongly predicted by photoperiod (as increasing day length), whereas water temperatures and flow rates were weak predictors and highly variable between years. Timings of river entry of individual shad were also consistent across consecutive spawning migrations, indicating high individual repeatability. The application of acoustic telemetry in this study thus revealed high repeatability in the timing of annual spawning migrations, which were cued mainly by increasing day length and that, being seasonally predictable, should ensure entry into freshwater with sufficient time to arrive in spawning areas when in-river environmental conditions are favourable.},

	abstract = {1. Migration timing in animals has important effects on life-history transitions. Human activities can alter migration timing of animals, and understanding the effects of such disruptions remains an important goal for applied ecology. Anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) inhabit fresh water as juveniles before migrating to the ocean where they gain {\textgreater}90\% of their biomass before returning to fresh water as adults to reproduce. Although construction of dams has delayed juvenile migration for many populations, we currently lack a synthesis of patterns in migration timing and how they relate to subsequent survival to adulthood for Pacific salmon, especially for at-risk populations. 2. We studied two groups of Pacific salmon from the Columbia River basin in the northwestern United States currently listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. We examined how the proportion of juveniles surviving to return as adults varied with year of migration, date of arrival in the estuary, water temperature and coastal ocean upwelling using data from over 40 000 individually tagged Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss. 3. In general, models with year, day and day2 had much better support from the data than those with temperature and upwelling. For Chinook salmon, we also found a residual effect of temperature after controlling for day, but the effect was small for steelhead. 4. For both species, juveniles migrating from early to mid-May survived 4–50 times greater than those migrating in mid-June. As expected, however, the estimated peak in survival varied among years, presumably reflecting interannual variation in the nearshore physical environment and trophic dynamics that affect salmon during the critical juvenile life stage. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate a possible management objective would be to speed arrival to the estuary by increasing springtime river flows. These findings also provide some insight into the mechanisms underlying seasonal differences in survival patterns, but additional studies are needed to better resolve the issue. Future changes to river flow and water temperature associated with climate change and human activities may further alter migration timing, and thus this phenomenon deserves further attention.},

For juvenile Pacic salmon, the timing of the seaward migration from fresh to marine waters is linked to early marine survival and adult returns. Seaward migration phenology is determined by interactions between the intrinsic attributes of individual species and environmental factors that are acting upon them. Temperature and discharge are two factors of the freshwater environment that have been shown to inuence intra- and interannual variation in juvenile salmon phenology, but these factors may affect the migrations of sympatric species differently. Understanding how variations in phenology change with environmental heterogeneity is a critical rst step in evaluating how the future climate may affect salmon. This is especially crucial for high-latitude rivers, where the pace of climate change is nearly twice as rapid as it is for more temperate areas. This research investigates the inuence of river conditions on the seaward migration phenology of Chinook, chum, and coho salmon in the Yukon River.

We review these diverse migration patterns and present data from Puget Sound illustrating the variation in downstream migration timing, residency in the Salish Sea, and upriver return timing. Recreational catch records indicate that proportionally fewer remain in the Salish Sea than in past decades for several species, and the declines began after peaks in the late 1970s – early 1980s. These declines resist easy explanation because the factors controlling residency are poorly understood, and the Salish Sea has changed over the past decades.

Our objectives were to determine whether significant size-selective mortality (SSM) in steelhead could be detected between early and later freshwater stages and between each of these freshwater stages and returning adults and, if so, how SSM varied between these life stages and mixed and snow precipitation zones. Scale-based size-at-annulus comparisons indicated that steelhead in the snow zone were significantly larger at annulus 1 than those in the mixed rain–snow zone. Size at annuli 2 and 3 did not differ between precipitation zones, and we found no precipitation zone × life stage interaction effect on size at annulus. Significant freshwater and marine SSM was evident between the juvenile and adult samples at annulus 1 and between each life stage at annuli 2 and 3. Rapid growth between the final freshwater annulus and the smolt migration did not improve survival to adulthood; rather, it appears that survival in the marine environment may be driven by an overall higher growth rate set earlier in life, which results in a larger size at smolt migration. Efforts for recovery of threatened Puget Sound steelhead could benefit by considering that SSM between freshwater and marine life stages can be partially attributed to growth attained in freshwater habitats and by identifying those factors that limit growth during early life stages.Received December 3, 2013; accepted February 25, 2014},

	abstract = {Life history diversity and productivity are key metrics used to evaluate the status of salmon populations. In this paper, we use long-term monitoring data from spawning escapement and a rotary screw trap to describe juvenile migration strategies and identify factors affecting freshwater productivity of Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha inhabiting the Green River, Washington. Similar to other populations in Puget Sound, Green River Chinook Salmon exhibit two distinct pulses of downstream, subyearling, juvenile migration. Small-bodied fry move downstream in late winter shortly after emergence (peaking in March), whereas larger-bodied parr migrate downstream after spending some time rearing and growing in freshwater (peaking in late May or early June). A series of stock–recruit models demonstrated that the production of parr was density dependent, as the Green River reaches rearing capacity at most observed spawner abundances and river conditions. By contrast, the production of fry was density independent. Furthermore, several river discharge metrics were significantly related to Chinook Salmon productivity. Total juvenile production was lower in years when incubating embryos experienced high-magnitude peak flows, most likely due to redd scour. Parr productivity was greater in years with higher discharge during the spring (April–June), which we hypothesize is related to increased accessibility of side channels for rearing and/or increased survival during migration. Combined, these results suggest that restoration of juvenile rearing habitats offers substantial potential benefits to parr productivity. Setting escapement goals for fishery planning that consider freshwater habitat capacity and life history diversity will largely depend on the relative marine survival of the fry and parr migration strategies. Our analysis also provides insight to managing water at an upstream dam to benefit Chinook Salmon productivity, though any such strategy faces trade-offs with other fish conservation goals and will be constrained by the dam's primary purpose of reducing flood risk.},

	abstract = {For over a century, hatchery programs have been used to subsidize natural salmon populations in order to increase fisheries opportunities and, more recently, to conserve declining natural populations. While an extensive literature has described the impacts of large-scale hatchery operations on freshwater ecosystems, less attention has been given to ecosystem interactions within the marine environment. We analyzed records of hatchery-released Chinook salmon in the Salish Sea to assess temporal and spatial changes in hatchery practices since 1950, with the goal of identifying potential implications for ecosystem dynamics and conservation efforts in the region. Over the past 65 yr, we found significant changes in the size and time at which juvenile salmon are released, resulting in decreased diversity of these traits. Research suggests that predation on juvenile salmon by other fish, avian, and marine mammal species could be size-dependent, and our results indicate that current hatchery practices are releasing Chinook salmon in the size range preferred by these predators. With current marine survival rates at chronically low levels, and increasing demand for hatchery subsidies, it is important to consider how modifying existing hatchery programs intended to reduce homogenization may promote more natural marine food web dynamics, with potential benefits to both hatchery and natural Chinook populations.},

	abstract = {Variation in life history traits within and across species is known to reflect adaptations to different environmental drivers through a diversity of mechanisms. Trait variation can also help buffer species and populations against extinction in fluctuating environments and against anthropogenic disturbances. Here, we examine the distribution and drivers of Ocean-type Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha) juvenile migratory life histories. We defined alternative migratory strategies according to whether individuals reared in the stream (natal rearing) or left shortly after hatching to rear elsewhere (non-natal rearing). We then evaluated the frequency of migratory strategies across 16 populations with time series extending up to 25 years and evaluated the environmental variables that influenced variation in migration strategy. We found bimodal migration patterns and abrupt transitions in migrant sizes across all populations, supporting the widespread nature of alternative migratory strategies. Additionally, we found that the amount of freshwater rearing habitat available to juveniles, relative juvenile density and spring flow patterns significantly influenced the overall migration pattern for populations. Smaller streams and higher conspecific densities generally produced more non-natal rearing migrants and larger streams and lower conspecific densities producing more natal rearing migrants. Our results shed light on previously unexplored patterns of juvenile migratory strategies and encourage broader consideration for how current conservation actions perform at protecting juvenile migratory diversity.},

	abstract = {Declines in the survival of steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) populations in protected waters of Washington and British Columbia have drawn attention to the need for more information on migratory patterns and losses in river, estuary, and nearshore habitats. Accordingly, acoustic telemetry was used to quantify movements by wild and hatchery steelhead smolts released from 2006 to 2009 in the Green River, and tracked through Puget Sound, Washington. Survival varied by release group and migration segment but overall survival rates from release to the Strait of Juan de Fuca were 9.7 \% for wild and 3.6 \% for hatchery fish. These rates are low relative to similar studies on steelhead. Survival was higher for wild fish along all migration segments than hatchery-origin fish; the greatest loss for both groups coincided with the slowest travel rates as fish first entered the estuary and as they exited Puget Sound. Wild fish travelled faster than hatchery fish in the river (15.1 vs. 4.4 km/d) with the fastest travel in the lower river (41 vs. 20.2 km/d) and slowest immediately after release (3.7 vs. 2.4 km/d). The travel rates of wild and hatchery fish became progressively more similar over time: 15.4 vs. 10.6 km/d in the estuary, and 10.3 vs. 9.3 km/d in nearshore areas. Movement was primarily nocturnal in the river, nearly equal between day and night in the upper estuary, and predominately diurnal in the lower estuary and nearshore waters, with no difference between wild and hatchery fish. The migration in marine water showed an early offshore movement and a strong northward and westward orientation, and all fish exited the Strait of Juan de Fuca rather than the Strait of Georgia. The findings support research suggesting that declines in wild and hatchery steelhead populations may be caused primarily by factors in the early marine period.},

	abstract = {On 16 May 1983 1750 tagged 1+ and 1280 tagged 2+ Atlantic salmon smolts of the River Imsa strain were released into the River Imsa in the evening. In 1984 1409 tagged 2+ smolts were divided into three groups. The first was released at 09.00 h on 21 May, the second group at 21.00 h the same evening, and the third group was released at 21.00 h the next evening. The smolts were recaptured in a Wolf trap, 1000 m downstream. To test effects on smolt migration, the light at the trap (4 lux) was switched on and off successively every 15 min during the first night after the 1983 release. In 1984 the whole width of a fast flowing part of the river was constantly illuminated (88 lux) during the first night after the last release. Most smolts descended during the first 12 h after release, and the smolts released in the morning descended in considerable numbers during daytime. 2+ smolts descended faster than did 1+ smolts. Small 1+ smolts descended faster than larger 1+ smolts whereas large 2+ smolts descended faster than smaller ones. Smolts released in the evening descended faster than smolts released in the morning. Illumination of the river during the night reduced the speed of descent, the effect being most pronounced in the pool just above the trap. Males that were mature in autumn 1983 smoltified and descended when released in 1984, but they were smaller than immature males and females. It is suggested that wild and hatchery smolts staying in the river may be attracted to shoals of released hatchery smolts and join them when migrating downstream.},

	abstract = {Routine estimation of stochastic growth rates from population count data can be badly biased when measurement errors are present. For univariate count time series – that is time series of population counts from a single site or population – a number of solutions have been developed for this problem. These solutions use a state-space approach that incorporates a process model and a measurement model. We extend this approach in order to analyze count data from multiple sites or subpopulations. We show how a multivariate state-space model can be used in a maximum likelihood framework to estimate the stochastic growth rates from multisite data. This modeling framework allows one to take into account the spatial correlation in growth rates or process variability across multiple sites. We also show how model selection, specifically Aikake’s information criteria (AlC) and a bootstrap variant designed for state-space models, can be used to make inferences about the underlying population structure. This allows researchers to measure the data support for alternative models of growth rate and covariance structure within the population. We apply multivariate state-space modeling to a multisite data set from endangered salmon populations in the Snake River basin},
